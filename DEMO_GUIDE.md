## üìù Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: How accurate are the calculations?**
> A: We use established scientific models from peer-reviewed papers. The crater scaling is based on Holsapple & Housen (2007), and deflection calculations match NASA's DART mission results. However, this is a simplified model for education - real planetary defense requires more detailed analysis.

**Q: Can this be used for actual planetary defense?**
> A: This is an educational tool. For actual planetary defense, NASA's CNEOS and international agencies use much more sophisticated models. However, our tool can help policymakers and the public understand the concepts.

**Q: What makes this different from other asteroid simulators?**
> A: Three key things: (1) Real NASA data integration, (2) Multiple mitigation strategies, and (3) Comprehensive educational features. Most simulators only show impacts - we show solutions too.

**Q: How long did this take to build?**
> A: This was built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge hackathon. The core features were developed during the hackathon period, with extensive documentation and polish added afterward.

**Q: Can I contribute or use this?**
> A: Absolutely! It's open source under MIT License. Check CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines. We welcome improvements, especially additional features or better scientific models.
