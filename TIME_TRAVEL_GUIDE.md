## 🔬 Scientific Accuracy

### Orbital Mechanics Used

**1. Mean Motion Calculation**
```javascript
meanMotion = (2π) / orbitalPeriod
```
- Determines how fast asteroid moves in orbit
- Based on NASA's orbital period data

**2. Mean Anomaly**
```javascript
meanAnomaly = meanMotion × timeOffset
```
- Position along orbit at given time
- Linear approximation of orbital motion

**3. Kepler's Equation**
```javascript
E = M + e × sin(E)
```
- Solves for eccentric anomaly (E)
- Accounts for elliptical orbit shape
- Iterative solution (5 iterations)

**4. True Anomaly**
```javascript
ν = 2 × atan2(√(1+e) × sin(E/2), √(1-e) × cos(E/2))
```
- Actual angular position in orbit
- Accounts for eccentricity

**5. Distance from Focus**
```javascript
r = a(1 - e²) / (1 + e×cos(ν))
```
- Distance varies with position in ellipse
- Closer at perihelion, farther at aphelion

**6. 3D Position**
```javascript
x = r × cos(ν)
z = r × sin(ν)
y = z × sin(inclination)
```
- Converts to 3D coordinates
- Applies orbital inclination

### Data Sources

All orbital calculations use:
- **Orbital Period**: From NASA's `orbital_data.orbital_period`
- **Eccentricity**: From NASA's `orbital_data.eccentricity`
- **Inclination**: From NASA's `orbital_data.inclination`
- **Semi-major Axis**: Calculated from close approach data
