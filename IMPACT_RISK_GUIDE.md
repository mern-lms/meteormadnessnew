## 📊 Risk Scales Explained

### Torino Scale (0-10)

**Purpose:** Communicate impact hazard to the public

| Level | Color | Description | Action |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | White | No hazard | Routine discovery |
| 1 | Green | Normal | Routine monitoring |
| 2-4 | Yellow | Merits attention | Astronomers' attention |
| 5-7 | Orange | Threatening | Government planning |
| 8-10 | Red | Certain collision | International action |

**Current Status:**
- No asteroid currently rated above 0
- Apophis was briefly rated 4 (now 0)
- Most objects are 0 or 1

### Palermo Scale

**Purpose:** Technical assessment for astronomers

**Formula:**
```
PS = log₁₀(Pi / Pb)
```
Where:
- Pi = Impact probability
- Pb = Background probability

**Interpretation:**
- **PS < -2**: No concern
- **PS -2 to 0**: Monitoring needed
- **PS > 0**: Serious concern

**Example:**
- PS = -3: 1/1000 of background risk
- PS = 0: Equal to background risk
- PS = +2: 100x background risk

### Impact Probability

**How it's calculated:**
1. Observe asteroid position
2. Calculate orbital uncertainty
3. Project orbit forward
4. Check for Earth intersections
5. Calculate probability

**Typical values:**
- Most asteroids: < 1 in 1,000,000
- Monitored objects: 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000
- High concern: > 1 in 10,000

**Example interpretations:**
- **1 in 10**: 10% chance (VERY HIGH - would be global emergency)
- **1 in 1,000**: 0.1% chance (High concern)
- **1 in 100,000**: 0.001% chance (Monitoring)
- **1 in 10,000,000**: 0.00001% chance (Routine)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Risk Data Showing

**Problem:** Asteroid has no Sentry data  
**Reason:** Most asteroids have zero impact risk  
**Solution:** This is normal - only ~1,500 objects have risk data

### API Errors

**Problem:** Failed to load Sentry data  
**Reason:** API might be temporarily unavailable  
**Solution:** App still works with NEO data; Sentry is supplemental

### Missing Asteroids

**Problem:** Can't find specific asteroid  
**Reason:** Limited to 150 asteroids for performance  
**Solution:** Increase limit in code or search NASA's website directly
