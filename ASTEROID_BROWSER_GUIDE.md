distance = clamp(distance, 2, 10) // Scale for visualization

// Speed calculation
speed = 0.001 / (orbitalPeriod / 365)

// Eccentricity from NASA data
eccentricity = orbitalData.eccentricity

// Inclination scaled for visualization
inclination = orbitalData.inclination * 0.01
```

- **Fast-moving asteroids** (>30 km/s)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Asteroids Not Showing

**Problem:** No asteroids in 3D view  
**Solution:** Click "Show All in 3D" button

### Can't Click Asteroids

**Problem:** Clicking doesn't select  
**Solution:** 
- Ensure asteroids are visible
- Try clicking directly on the asteroid sphere
- Check browser console for errors

### Details Panel Not Appearing

**Problem:** No panel after clicking  
**Solution:**
- Check if asteroid was successfully selected (turns yellow)
- Try clicking another asteroid
- Refresh the page

### Slow Performance

**Problem:** 3D view is laggy  
**Solution:**
- Hide asteroids when not needed
- Close other browser tabs
- Reduce number of asteroids (edit code: change `slice(0, 20)` to `slice(0, 10)`)
